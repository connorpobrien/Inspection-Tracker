# Reload-Notify-Program

## Purpose
This project was created to automatically monitor the San Jose building department website to check for available inspection appointments. 

**Use of this program helped decrease the total schedule duration by 3-4 weeks for a $50M private construction project.** A missing electrical inspection was blocking work from continuing on the project, causing serious cost and schedule problems. This program notified the team when sooner inspections were available due to cancellations.

## How it works
Technologies used: Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and Pygame libraries. 

**Selenium** is a free, open source tool that is used to automate browsers. For this project, Selenium was used to launch a chrome browser and automate the sign in process for the San Jose building department website. This helps set user login credentials and enables continuous searching.

**Beautiful Soup** is a python library that is used to pull data out of HTML and XML files. For this project, Beautiful Soup was used to extract the HTML content of the inspection page and enables the user to search for a specific date and discipline of inspection. 

**Pygame** is a python module that is designed for writing video games. For this project, Pygame is used simply to play a .mov file. This alerts the user when the inspection is available.
